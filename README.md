Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic face detection system using Python and the OpenCV library. The system is implemented in Google Colab, utilizing a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to identify and highlight human faces in an image. The project is designed for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing.
Objectives
